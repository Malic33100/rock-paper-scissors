Rock paper scissors

This is a project I did that was outlined by theodinproject.com

The idea is to create a game of rock,paper,and scissors that a person could play with the computer, and the best of 5 games wins. 

THis is my first self led project and there are still some issues, so im mainly posting this project so I can look back and see how far 
ive come on my coding journey.

Thanks for checking it out!
