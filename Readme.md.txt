Rock paper scissors

This is a project I did that was outlined by theodinproject.com

The idea is to create a game of rock,paper,and scissors that a person could play with the computer, and the best of 5 games wins. 

THis is my first self led project and there are still some issues, so im mainly posting this project so I can look back and see how far 
ive come on my coding journey. I started out with the game being played in the console, but I wanted the player to be able to simply 
click a button and be able to play. This was more complicated than I first had believed, becuase I had to not only rework how I retrieved user input,
but I also had to rework the functions to match the different input source. All in all, I learned about THe DOM tree, how to work with event listeners,
and troubleshooting in general.

Thanks for checking it out!
